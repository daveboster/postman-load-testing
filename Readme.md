# Postman Load testing
This is a proof of concept for taking API calls using the Postman collections to quickly perform load testing on software environments.

## Prerequisites
- [Postman Installation](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
- [Install Grafana K6](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)
